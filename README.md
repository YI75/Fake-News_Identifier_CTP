# Fake-News-CTP-Fall-Project

Under CUNY Tech Prep, the goal of this project was to develop a real-time machine learning model that can detect social media news authenticity. User can submit news headlines in the form of strings, and the app identifies the headline as either real or fake news. The output is be boolean.  

Using the kaggle dataset linked below of news headlines, the article text, and the news set labeled as REAL or FAKE, our app hosted on Streamlit takes the string inputed by users through a string cleanup pipeline in order to use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classificaton algorithm. Our app has a 90% accuracy rate.
